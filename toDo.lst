ToDo list:

 - merge pending_new and new events to increase processing time and decrease thread switching
 - add weak transactions to able process dependant transactions concurently
 - Review state machine, does onInternalCancel required for the Market orders only?
 - check preparing correct ExecReport, CancelRequest messages
 - check adding ExecReports into the OrderEntry::executions_  
 - check order matching
 - finish tests for the states
 - finish test for the processor: when one order gone to finish state, can Processor continue process events?
 - add logic for processing various order types
 - add processing timer events
 - add logic to enqueue event back into queue if processing IncomingQueues::pop fails
 - change string reasons (reject also) to error codes
 - add file (xml?) configuration, constants should be used as default values
 * check thread-safe - concurent transactions applied to the same order
 * port to the GCC compiler
 - change OrderDataStorage::locateByOrderId() to use tbb hash_map container
